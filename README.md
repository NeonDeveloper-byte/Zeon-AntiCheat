## 📌 Purpose
The Zeon Authorization List ensures that Federation Anticheat is used only in approved Roblox experiences.  
This keeps the system secure and reliable for everyone.

## 🚫 Unauthorized Use
- Games not listed here are not authorized to run Zeon Anticheat.  
- If a game ID isn’t on the list, the script will refuse to execute.  
- Please don’t attempt to bypass or redistribute the system.
