# Federation Authorization List

This repository contains the **list of Roblox game IDs** that are authorized to use the Federation Anticheat script.  
If you don’t trust our script — we don’t care. This project is strictly for developers who want to integrate Federation Anticheat into their games.

> [!INFO]  
> **Purpose**  
> The Federation Authorization List ensures that only approved Roblox experiences can run Federation Anticheat.  
> The script checks against this list before execution.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Unauthorized Use**  
> Any Roblox game ID not included here is **not authorized**.  
> Attempts to bypass this restriction may result in detection and denial of service.

> [!CAUTION]  
> **Trust Policy**  
> We do not provide guarantees or support for games outside the authorization list.  
> If you don’t trust the script, that’s fine.  
> While this may feel like an insult to you, it is for our own protection.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Federation Anticheat checks the **Place ID** of the running game.  
- If the ID matches one in this list, the script runs normally.  
- If not, the script will refuse to execute.
